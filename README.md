# employeeData

# This application is intended to be a tool for the management of employee data.

# Employees enter their name, title, start day of working at the company, and monthly pay rate.

# Each employee's information is stored in the firebase database, and dynamically prepended to the table at the bottom of the page.

# Incorporated into the table is also the total number of months worked by the employee and the total amount of pay they have received over the time of their employment.
